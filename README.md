# Tic-tac-toe

Web app to play Tic-tac-toe

## Some rule

- To move you have to be on the last layout of the match in the default order. The history is just to visualize the past moves, not to undo them.
- Who starts first?
  - In the first game the starter symbol is X
  - In case of draw the starter symbol is switched
  - If the winner symbol is the starter one, on the next match is switched
  - If the winner symbol is not the starter one, it means who played with the starter symbol is a poor player, so I'll give him/her another chance
